This project is a neuroimaging meta-analysis of psychological resilience (MeSH D055500).
Additionally, this project is an exercise in embracing FAIR data principles to promote Open Science.

We have curated a systematic review of psychological resilience in the non-proprietary reference manager Zotero.
Using the Notes field, we have annotated each article with inclusion/exclusion criteria and relevant data for a GingerALE meta-analysis.

This python code extracts relevant data (specifically, roi coordinates) in the text-based format that GingerALE requires.
